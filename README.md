# ProtoIoT
This repository contains three types of data: (a) per-flow packet traces of ten consumer IoT devices (inside the folder [device-traffic-data](https://github.com/savinduwannigama/ProtoIoT/tree/main/device-traffic-data)), (b) protocol-specific attributes and parameters used by the ten IoT devices (inside the folder [protocol-data-analysis](https://github.com/savinduwannigama/ProtoIoT/tree/main/protocol-data-analysis)), and (c) JSON-formatted data model for six commonly used IoT protocols: TLS, HTTP, DNS, NTP, DHCP, and SSDP (inside the folder [protocol-data-models](https://github.com/savinduwannigama/ProtoIoT/tree/main/protocol-data-models)).
